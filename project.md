Basic RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) is a student project. Enterprise RAG with strict evaluation and monitoring is an Applied AI project.

The Business Problem: A company wants an internal AI assistant to answer employee questions based on thousands of internal PDFs, Confluence pages, and Slack messages. However, they cannot afford hallucinations and need to know if the AI's accuracy degrades over time.

The Solution: Build a RAG pipeline that ingests heterogeneous data, chunks it intelligently, and retrieves it using hybrid search. Crucially, build an evaluation pipeline to measure accuracy and an observability layer to trace every query.

Tech Stack:
Core: LlamaIndex or LangChain, OpenAI/Anthropic API (or local Llama 3).
Vector DB: Qdrant or Weaviate.
Evaluation: RAGAS or DeepEval (to measure faithfulness, context precision).
Observability: LangSmith, Arize Phoenix, or Langfuse.
Backend/Frontend: FastAPI, React 19 + TypeScript (Vite).

Key "Applied" Features to Highlight:
Implement Hybrid Search (Keyword + Vector) and Reranking (e.g., Cohere Rerank or BGE-Reranker) to improve retrieval accuracy.
Create a "Golden Dataset" of Q&A pairs and write a CI/CD script that runs the RAGAS evaluation every time you change a prompt or chunking strategy.
Show a dashboard tracking latency, token cost, and retrieval metrics.
